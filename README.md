**Purpose of the Project**

Our project, Build YourSelf, is an intuitive web application designed to streamline the registration and job application process for students and teachers at training centers. Our goal is to enhance the digital experience while fostering educational growth.

**Technologie used**

HTML: We chose HTML as it is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provided the structure of our application and is a fundamental technology we wanted to leverage.
CSS: We used CSS for styling the HTML elements. It enhanced the look and feel of our application, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
JavaScript (JS): We opted for JavaScript without any additional frameworks for the frontend. This decision was made to solidify our understanding of JavaScript and its core concepts. It also made our website interactive and is essential for client-side scripting.
Express.js: For the backend, we chose Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. It allowed us to build our web application and APIs more efficiently and effectively.
MySQL: We used MySQL, a relational database management system, for storing and retrieving data. It was chosen for its reliability and wide usage in the industry.
Render: We used Render for hosting and serverless backend services for our web application. It allowed us to keep our site up-to-date directly from our repository.
SMTP Service: We integrated an SMTP Service for sending emails. This feature is crucial for various purposes such as sending registration confirmations, password resets, notifications, and more to our users.
In the development of Build YourSelf, we made a conscious decision to work without using any CSS framework. This was done to give us more hands-on experience and practice with CSS, allowing us to better understand and apply its principles.
 
For the backend, we chose to use Express.js over Flask, despite having prior experience with Flask. The reason behind this choice was our desire to learn and grow.

**Features**

Responsive Design: Our application is designed to be responsive and compatible with mobile and tablet views. This means users can access the project from any device, providing flexibility and convenience.
User-Friendly Interface with Dark Mode: We’ve focused on creating a user-friendly interface that includes a dark mode. This not only enhances the visual appeal of our application but also provides a comfortable viewing experience for users, especially in low-light conditions.
Easy Account Creation: We’ve streamlined the account creation process, making it easy for users to create accounts. This simplifies the registration process and allows users to quickly access the features and resources available on our platform.

**Future Steps**

As a part of my continuous learning journey and commitment to improving Build YourSelf, I plan to recreate the website using different technologies in the future. This includes exploring CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap to enhance the design and user interface of the application.
 
In addition, I’m also interested in diving into PHP frameworks such as Laravel for backend development. This will not only allow me to learn and apply a new programming language but also provide an opportunity to compare and contrast different technologies.
 
By recreating the website with these different technologies, I aim to broaden my skill set, gain new insights, and further improve the functionality and user experience of Build YourSelf. This aligns with my goal of continuous growth and improvement as a IT engineer.
