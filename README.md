**Purpose of the Project**
Our project, Build YourSelf, is an intuitive web application designed to streamline the registration and job application process for students and teachers at training centers. Our goal is to enhance the digital experience while fostering educational growth.

**Technologie used**
HTML: We chose HTML as it is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provided the structure of our application and is a fundamental technology we wanted to leverage.
CSS: We used CSS for styling the HTML elements. It enhanced the look and feel of our application, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
JavaScript (JS): We opted for JavaScript without any additional frameworks for the frontend. This decision was made to solidify our understanding of JavaScript and its core concepts. It also made our website interactive and is essential for client-side scripting.
Express.js: For the backend, we chose Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. It allowed us to build our web application and APIs more efficiently and effectively.
MySQL: We used MySQL, a relational database management system, for storing and retrieving data. It was chosen for its reliability and wide usage in the industry.
Render: We used Render for hosting and serverless backend services for our web application. It allowed us to keep our site up-to-date directly from our repository.
SMTP Service: We integrated an SMTP Service for sending emails. This feature is crucial for various purposes such as sending registration confirmations, password resets, notifications, and more to our users.
In the development of Build YourSelf, we made a conscious decision to work without using any CSS framework. This was done to give us more hands-on experience and practice with CSS, allowing us to better understand and apply its principles.
 
For the backend, we chose to use Express.js over Flask, despite having prior experience with Flask. The reason behind this choice was our desire to learn and grow.
